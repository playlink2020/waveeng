    m_Localized: '    In the augmented reality pop-up book The Waves: Shattering
      Blue Nights, a brand new space opens up as you flip the page. The big blue
      waves seeped into the page feel fantastically melancholic yet the story it
      carries leaves spots of tenderness in mind. I hope The Waves can bring comfort
      to those who, like Celeste, are experiencing the weight of  apathy and depression.
      I hope  that  we can get through the hard times together.

    m_Localized: "    There is a woman lying on her bed. Days and nights pass as
      she lies on her bed. One dark night, her bed starts to drift away to the ocean.
      She is alone in the ocean. Right before she gets swept away by a big tide,
      she wakes up and saves herself. The ocean calms down. Her bed arrives on a
      small island. There she finds a labyrinth with many stairs. When she manages
      to get out of the labyrinth, she finds other beds left on the shore. She wonders
      to herself, \u201Cwhere are all these floating bed frames coming from?\n"
